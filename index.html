        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Gael Garcia and I am a Senior at Portland State University studying Computer Science! 
          My ultimate goal is to be able to use the skills I have learned as a software engineer in order to aid companies 
          with the creation of a more sustainable environent. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I find that now more than ever 
          it is important to consider how the technology we use affects the world around us, and I want to use my education to help 
          preserve the place I grew up in! 
        </p>

          <div class="project-decription golden-goose-desc">
            <p>The goal for Project Golden Goose is to serve as copy of the website <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" class="in-text-link" target="_blank">DNDbeyond</a>, but a bit more accessible for the average player! 
              Although the DNDbeyond website works well enough for the current Fifth Edition ruleset (or 5e for short), that is not to say that it is 
              flawless. Our main gripes with the site lie with paywalled content that is readily avaliable online, an inventory system that can be improved 
              upon, character sheet limits with free accounts, and most importantly to us, a solid lack of homebrew implementation! Through this project we hope 
              to supply our close friends with a better platform to run our campaigns with the inclusion of a more optimized homebrew experience! We are hoping to
              have a fully deployable website in the near future. Although we know we cannot fully release this due to the potential wrath of Wizards of the Coast,
              being able to use our web development skills to create a better experience for our close friends is all we can hope for. We have thus far used HTML, CSS
              and JavaScript to create the current foundation of our site, although it is still in very early development. You can click the links below to see our
              current landing page, as well as view our current working codebase.

            <p>Frupal is a small game developed entirely in Python using its built in GUI Tkinter! The object of the game is fairly 
            simple: navigate throughout the map and attempt to claim all the diamonds without running out of energy! There are items to encounter that will help 
            you on your journey, obstacles that will make it harder for you to traverse through the map, and different types of terrain that will consume more 
            energy for each cell you step in! Developed over the summer in my CS314 class, while the game itself was fairly easy to implement as a team, it mainly 
            acted as an exercise in software development within a team of people. Following the SCRUM development process, the goal of the class was to demonstrate 
            how our team would be working in industry by following this design process. To play the game, you can click the download button below and run the 
            executable file on your desktop computer!
